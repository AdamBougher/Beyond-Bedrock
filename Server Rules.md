# Server Rules
1. The Ultimate Rule: Messing with and minorly griefing your friends is fine, but it’s up to you to know the boundaries. If you’re doing something and it’s upsetting someone to where they report you, you will be responsible and “I was just messing around” will not be an adequate excuse. This applies (but is not limited) to:
    * Damaging / killing other players.
    * Taking items from other players without permission.
    * Griefing, destroying, reconfiguring, or otherwise disrupting property that clearly belongs to or is shared with another player.
    * Chunk-claiming an area that clearly belongs to or is shared with another player.
    * Building over, too close to, or otherwise blocking other players’ properties.
    * Annoying or in general being disruptive towards a player.

    Again, you can do the above to your friends, but if it is upsetting someone, mediation will become involved.
2. Please don’t get too NSFW / NSFL or otherwise inappropriate with builds or in chat. Keep in mind that younger people may be playing on the server.
3. Don’t destroy, grief, chunk-claim, obstruct, or steal from admin-placed buildings near the spawn (like the Seven Curses Shrine).
4. Don’t steal from someone’s shops (or anything leading to or supplying the shop) under **any** circumstances.
5. **Do not break another player’s gravestone** unless it’s cluttering your property. If you do break someone’s gravestone, you very much should set aside the contents of the grave in a clearly marked and accessible chest nearby. If you don’t properly save the dead player’s items, you’re subject to rule 1.
6. Don’t break Lootr (Instanced Loot Chests) unless you really, really have to.

## Conduct
1. Please do your due diligence when working with any items or mods that can do severe damage to the surrounding area. 
    * Encase things that can explode in layers of blast-resistant material, or stuff them into a compact-machine dimension.
    * Don’t leave radiation-emitting materials out on the floor or in your inventory. They seem to stop emitting radiation inside chests and drawers.
    * If you cannot do the above, move any hazardous activity to a more remote location away from other people’s builds.
2. Try not to make the world too ugly.
    *The Hole Filler mod can be used to very quickly patch up creeper explosions.
    * If you need to tear up the surface for materials (sand, dirt, etc), try to do it underground or further away from spawn and isolated from other peoples’ bases.
    * Cover up unused quarries with whatever terrain was there before you made it.
    * Clean up the gravestones you leave behind when you die. Even though players are encouraged by rule 6 to let them be, they will be allowed to destroy them if they’re not picked up after an excessive period of time.
3. Try your best to be performance friendly with farms and large tech setups. Don’t let this stop you from being ambitious, it will only be an issue if server performance starts to fall off- after which excessively laggy builds will be asked to be modified or unloaded. Keep the following in mind as a courtesy to your fellow players:
    * Prefer using Hostile Neural Networks or non-spawning methods for farming mass amounts of mob drops.
    * Use the blocks from Easy Villagers to do trades with villagers without loading them as mobs
    * Use Create Trains to move items, fluids, and energy across long distances instead of pipes.
    * Whenever a mod allows you to, try to use fewer, stronger machines to accomplish some goal rather than using several weaker ones. (AKA, try to lower your number of ticking entities).
    * Be conscious of your chunk loading (done via the Chunk Schedudeler). Remember that certain things work across unloaded chunks, such as Create Trains and certain logistical items.
4. Feel free to use things like auto-clickers and macros. In fact, I’d recommend using one if you need to hold / spam mouse buttons for a long time, as this is horrible on your wrist tendons in the long-term. Doubly so if you’re moving the mouse at the same time (like when strip mining).
