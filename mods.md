* ***C+*** \- This mod is **definitely** complex and not recommended to players new to modded gameplay.  
* ***B*** \- Beginner friendly\! C:  
* ***O*** \- This mod is or has the capacity to be very overpowered compared to similar options. Exercise some restraint if you don’t want to steamroll everything.  
* **\!\!** \- Elements of this mod can cause significant, difficult to fix damage to your base or many chunks surrounding it. Consider shoving them into a Compact Machine dimension if needed.

## Integrated Dynamics ( C+ )

* Provides a programming-style pipe network which can interact with the world in very, very customizable ways using variables and filters.  
* It is often said “If nothing else can do what you’re trying to do, Integrated Dynamics can”.

* 📚: *On the Dynamics of Integration*  
* 🏆: *Integrated Dynamics*
