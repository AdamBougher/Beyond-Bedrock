This guide contains some useful information for playing the pack.

# **Just Enough Items (JEI)**

	Just Enough Items is an **integral** mod to understand in order to play modpacks.  
![][image1]  
	JEI is seen on the right side of this image. It provides a search bar you can use to search through every item and block in the pack.

* Pressing ‘R’ while hovering over an item will **show you ways you can craft** that item.  
* Pressing ‘U’ while hovering over an item will **show you things you can craft WITH that item**.

	You can also perform either of those two actions while hovering over things in your own inventory as well.  
![][image2]  
	Above shows the ‘R’ecipe display for *Iron Plate*. We can see that it can be crafted with an ingot and a hammer. Further, the tabs across the top show other crafting apparatus we can use to make plates as well (Note that I could press ‘U’ or ‘R’ on any items here to investigate further\!)

In the search bar, you can filter the list to specific items by name. You can also use special prefixes to filter by other things:

* ***@**Mekanism* will search for any items provided by the mod *Mekanism*.  
* **\#***curse* will search for anything that has *“curse”* somewhere in the item’s tooltip.  
* ***$**nickel* will search for anything with a tag continuing ‘nickel’.

	Use JEI frequently to see what things you find can be crafted with and crafted into, as this is how you will discover all kinds of things you can do. 

# **Health and Healing**

	You will immediately notice that your maximum health is half of what it used to be\! Furthermore, the natural regeneration (food healing) you get is *significantly* slower.

* You start off with 5 hearts. **To get more health, collect and eat unique, filling foods** (\>7 hunger restored)\! Use a ‘Food Book’ to track your progress.  
* Use healing items and gear to supplement your slower natural healing.  
  * Bandages are cheap to craft and heal you quickly, *but their regeneration is canceled if you take damage*.  
  * Potions stack now, making them easier to keep around.

# **Mobs**	

#### Caves

	Some of the mod’s stronger mobs are hanging out down in caves, making caving particularly dangerous\! Once you travel down to the deepslate layer, you can run into some mini-boss style mobs as well.

#### Autoleveling

	All mobs have a ‘scaling level’ seen next to their name. Each level minorly improves their stats (speed, armor, health, damage, etc.), with every 30 levels being about a doubling of strength and a max level of 90\. Higher level mobs also drop more XP.  
	Mobs get stronger as you travel further from spawn. They will also gain \~15 levels as you get closer to bedrock. 

#### Tips

	You can find some good equipment simply by exploring the surface. Consider doing this when starting out rather than taking on caving if you are having trouble. Try to set up a farm and make some higher quality food beforehand as well so you can get a few extra hearts.  
	**Many mobs will be grossly stronger than you starting out** when you have no special gear and low hearts. You can use some underhanded tactics to get an upper hand if you’re struggling:

* Carry around lava in a bucket and get mobs to walk into it for massive damage.  
* Force them to fight in water where they are often much slower than you.  
* Place down boats in front of enemies. Most of them are dumb and will mount the boat and become completely stuck.

# **Mod Advancements**

Fortunately, many mods add their own tabs to the game’s Advancements menu (Press ‘L’, or access from the Pause Menu) which give you a flowchart of things you can do to experience all of its features.

# **Mapping**

	**M:** Open the full screen map. You can right click on it to place waypoints\!  
	**Ctrl+M**: Toggle the Minimap.

# **Cooking**

	You’ll need to make some more impressive food than is available in vanilla if you want to get your maximum health up. The *Farmer’s Delight* mod provides plenty of recipes to get you started.   
	Follow the advancements for *Farmer’s Delight* to get started.

# **The End**

	Opening the End Portal has been overhauled via the *End Remastered* mod. Instead of inserting 12 ender eyes into the portal frame to activate the portal, the portal must now be slotted with 12 **unique** eyes, found by adventuring across a multitude of Minecraft’s features and activities.  
	Once inside, players will find themselves battling a significantly stronger and more complex version of the ender dragon. Be ready for a tough fight\!

# **Other Tips and Tweaks**

* Don’t overwhelm yourself\! Remember: nothing is forcing you to pick up every interesting thing you see. If you see something and don’t know what it does, you can almost always come back to it later if you’re already busy.  
  * Try to pick a few mods to focus on and learn- there is simply too much for you to learn all at once.  
* As stated above, use the Advancements Menu ‘L’ and any in-game provided books to learn how to progress and use certain mods.  
* Anvils are patched to be less stupid than in vanilla:  
  * No longer consume *any* XP to rename items.  
  * Repairs done on the anvil **no longer** increase the ‘prior work’ penalty on the item- You can repair your gear without any fear of incremental costs.  
  * XP cost on the anvil consumes the correct amount of XP rather than eating entire levels (I.E A repair claiming to cost 2 levels will consume the same amount of XP at level 5 and level 50).  
* You can craft Saddles and Name Tags.  
* The day-length is doubled, so a Minecraft day has 20 minutes of daytime and 10 minutes of night-time.  
* Villagers can be picked up by Sneak-right-clicking them with an empty hand.  
* Chickens shed feathers (drop them on the floor) slowly over time.

	

# **Seven Curses Ring (Hard Mode)**

	Near spawn, you can pick up a ‘Ring of The Seven Curses’. Equipping it will permanently bind it to you, not able to be removed through conventional means (even by death)\! This will put you on ‘hard mode’, and confers the following effects:

* Take 50% more damage from all sources  
* Your armor value and toughness is reduced by 50%  
* Deal 25% less damage to mobs  
* Once lit on fire, you will burn *forever* until you jump into water.  
* **All neutral mobs within 24 blocks instantly turn hostile to you**.  
  * This includes things like wolves, iron golems, and piglins which can make certain gameplay features very tricky\!  
  * Grimoire of Gaia adds some particularly stronger neutral mobs roaming the surface at **daytime**. This will make even surface exploration more hostile.  
* Dying causes you to drop a Soul Crystal, forfeiting 10% of your maximum health until you pick it up again.

You do gain the following benefits from being in hard mode:

* Extra rolls on mob loot tables (equivalent to one level of looting enchantment)  
* \+1 level of fortune for breaking any blocks  
* \+400% experience gained  
* Access to your Ender Chest inventory directly within your regular one.  
* Additional, rare drops from certain mobs (ghast tears from Witches, netherite scrap from wither skeletons, etc.

	Furthermore, usage of the Seven Curses Ring gives you access to some unique items and relics (search “*@enigmatic curses”* in JEI to see them) with strong upsides or alterations to the curses’ downsides.  
	Some of the relics require you to have spent \>90% of your time on the world in hard mode, so you should commit to this early if you’d like to reap the benefits\!

#### Removal

	To remove the Seven Curses Ring, you must create an *Unholy Stone*. With it in your inventory, jump into one of the Nether’s lava lakes. When you respawn, the ring will be gone and the curses (and it’s bestowed upsides) will be gone.  
	**Note**: Even after removing the curse, you will still have to pick up any dropped Soul Crystals to undo the 10% HP penalty from dropping one. You should do this BEFORE removing the curse, as you won’t have access to the Soul Crystal Compass afterwards\!  
The *Unholy Stone* requires some later game items to create, minimally requiring a Nether Star (Wither Skeleton kill) to create. So putting it on early means you’ll be stuck with it for quite some time\!  
	However, if the ring is seriously affecting your enjoyment on the server and you do not think you can bear with it, you can request an admin to remove it from your character. This, of course, is a one-time courtesy- you’re locked in if you put it back on again afterward ;)
